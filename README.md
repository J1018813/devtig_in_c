# devtig_in_c

I started tagging along with the book Writing an interpreter in Go by Thorsten Ball. After completing the first chapter I noticed that I wasn't pickin up enough on what my code was actually doing. So, I decided to rewrite it in C. This will force me to understand what the code actually means. It will also have the additional benefit that I can practice writing in C.

The actual programming language that this project produces isn't really useful and shouldn't be used for anything.
